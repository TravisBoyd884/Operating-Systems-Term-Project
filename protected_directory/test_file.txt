This is a test file that will be used to demonstrate 
the file operations monitoring capabilities of the sandbox.

The sandbox should intercept:
1. Opening this file (open syscall)
2. Reading from this file (read syscall)
3. Writing to this file (write syscall)

When you run the file_operations_test program under the sandbox,
you should be prompted for each operation.
